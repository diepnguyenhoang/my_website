Project management \u00b6 2nd day of week 1, I worked on configuring HTML, VCS (GITLAB, GITHUB) and started to get used to the documentation process. To be honest, I did not get familiar with the term \u201cdocumentation\u201d, because in my faculty, we usually use \u201clearning journal\u201d instead. Therefore, if you have similar feeling, you can think it simply as document or make diary of whatever you have learnt. Another thing is that, while studying the materials/ watching tutorials, I usually used screen-capture and pasted all the photos into my Onenote for later easy documentation. HTML, CSS, JavaScript \u00b6 Normally, a website includes 3 main parts: HTML (content and structure), CSS (style, e.g. colors, elements positions, and text sizes) and Javascript (provide interaction with the users) 1.HTML The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Wikipedia . To create a basic website, all we need is a basic text editor (such as Notepad, or Notepad ++). Of course we can consider other applications including: Sublime text, Visual studio go, Brackets\u2026 Once having a text editor installed in your laptop, we need to know about the Anatomy of HTML elements https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started (which look like syntax with heading and ending signal) and write what we want to show in our website. I wrote my first website in the Notepad ++ and named it \u201cindex.html\u201d in website interface, it looks like this 2.CSS Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. wikipedia . To create style for what we wrote, we need to have another text document featuring the styles we want. For example, I want my header will be in red. I will write the rule like this to a new text document, and name it styles.css h1 { color: red; } To link the style to index.html, we need to write a rule inside the of our index.html and it will show in website as below 3.JavaScript would not be our focus in this course but it is about the interactions/behaviors for users such as a list down menu\u2026 VCS (Version Control System) - Gitlab vs Github \u00b6 VCS is a software which records changes, permits recall older versions, and enables collaboration. Among VCS softwares, we choose GIT (Gitlab, Github) due to its free, simple, fast, and open platform. Since the main aim of this week is to have my own website deployed in class repository (either gitlab or github) , so we need to do following steps: Have an account in gitlab or github and create a new project. This will be the place we store our website. Setup GIT in my computer (install from https://git-scm.com/downloads , and configure git with my name and email address) Generate SSH keys: we need these keys to authenticate ourselves with the system so that it knows we are the one who owns the project. We have 2 types of SSH keys: private key (which will store in our local file), and public key (which everyone can see and get) To create SSH keys: I type the command ssh-keygen -t rsa -C \u201cyour.email@example.com\u201d -b 4096 into the Git CMD Then it will generate the 2 keys in my local repo. To pair up with the remote repo in gitlab, we need to open the file .pub in text document and copy it into our gitlab project (Preferences/SSH Keys) Download the remote repository to our computer (creating a local repository), we need to clone it by using git clone url To get the URL, we need to go to our project created in gitlab, and copy it to the command In the Git CMD, I had trouble on pasting the SSH URL, so I tried with the HTTPS as suggested from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/54518 and it worked. After that, in our local repo, you will find a README text documentation, and that means we have successfully linked to the local repo from the remote repo. Now, we can add our index.html and styles.css to the local folder. Update the remote repo: any changes or modification from the local repo need to be updated so as to see in the remote repo. In the GIT CMD git status => to check the status of the remote repo git add . => to add any changes git commit -m \"message\" => to commit/confirm our modification git push => to update and move the changes to remote repo Host/Deploy our website in github I have been setting up using gitlab account, however, to facilitate the website deployment, we need to also set up CI/CD Pipelines which will help to automate our software delivery process. Unfortunately, gitlab will ask us to fill in our credit card information in order to use this function. It is a bit inconvenient for me to do so. Therefore, I will use github instead and set up from the beginning, but this time, we will write website using Markdowns (not HTML). Create new project in github Create new folder (local repository) for the website Copy the files template downloaded from the gitlab website (see the Markdown session below) to the local repo Remove the 2 files which we don\u2019t need for github Go to Docs to edit the index.html (home page) and other pages if you want Important tip - rename docs folder to _docs => anything we want to modify for our website in local repo will be excuted in this folder. - create new folder and name it: docs => do not touch this folder, this will store data generated from the remote repo. - open mkdocs.yml in notepad++ => change to relevant information, such as: site name\u2026 and especially docs_dir: change from \u201cdocs\u201d to \u201c_docs\u201d, and site_dir: change from \u201csite\u201d to \u201cdocs\u201d Push the local repo to the remote repo using the guideline below. Make sure you are in the correct directory of the website in command line After the git push, our remote repo should show the similar files as our local repo. At this stage, there will be one folder docs missing in the remote repo. Here, we need to go to the Setting in our github project, choose Pages Go to command line (not git cmd), tell the system to build docs file => type mkdocs build Git status Git add . Git commit Git push We will finally have linked the file \u201cdocs\u201d from local repo to remote repo Any modification is done later in local repo must be updated in remote repo following mkdocs build > git status > git add > git commit > git push.

Computer Aided design \u00b6 In this week, I have been introduced various types of computer-aided design tools for making 2D and 3D prototypes.

Model (raster, vector, 2D, 3D, render, animate, simulate, \u2026) a possible final project, compress images and videos. 2D Design \u00b6 There are 2 types of 2D graphics: raster graphics and vector graphics. While raster images are in pixels, vector graphics are in geometric primitives (lines, curves) Most photos are in raster images (tiff, jpeg, gif, pcx, bmp), vector graphics are usually in ai, eps, svg, pdf format.
