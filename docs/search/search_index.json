Project management \u00b6 2nd day of week 1, I worked on configuring HTML, VCS (GITLAB, GITHUB) and started to get used to the documentation process. To be honest, I did not get familiar with the term \u201cdocumentation\u201d, because in my faculty, we usually use \u201clearning journal\u201d instead. Therefore, if you have similar feeling, you can think it simply as document or make diary of whatever you have learnt. Another thing is that, while studying the materials/ watching tutorials, I usually used screen-capture and pasted all the photos into my Onenote for later easy documentation. HTML, CSS, JavaScript \u00b6 Normally, a website includes 3 main parts: HTML (content and structure), CSS (style, e.g. colors, elements positions, and text sizes) and Javascript (provide interaction with the users) 1.HTML The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Wikipedia . To create a basic website, all we need is a basic text editor (such as Notepad, or Notepad ++). Of course we can consider other applications including: Sublime text, Visual studio go, Brackets\u2026 Once having a text editor installed in your laptop, we need to know about the Anatomy of HTML elements https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started (which look like syntax with heading and ending signal) and write what we want to show in our website.

To create style for what we wrote, we need to have another text document featuring the styles we want. For example, I want my header will be in red. I will write the rule like this to a new text document, and name it styles.css h1 { color: red; } To link the style to index.html, we need to write a rule inside the of our index.html and it will show in website as below 3.JavaScript would not be our focus in this course but it is about the interactions/behaviors for users such as a list down menu\u2026 VCS (Version Control System) - Gitlab vs Github \u00b6 VCS is a software which records changes, permits recall older versions, and enables collaboration. Among VCS softwares, we choose GIT (Gitlab, Github) due to its free, simple, fast, and open platform. Since the main aim of this week is to have my own website deployed in class repository (either gitlab or github) , so we need to do following steps: Have an account in gitlab or github and create a new project. This will be the place we store our website. Setup GIT in my computer (install from https://git-scm.com/downloads , and configure git with my name and email address) Generate SSH keys: we need these keys to authenticate ourselves with the system so that it knows we are the one who owns the project. We have 2 types of SSH keys: private key (which will store in our local file), and public key (which everyone can see and get) To create SSH keys: I type the command ssh-keygen -t rsa -C \u201cyour.email@example.com\u201d -b 4096 into the Git CMD Then it will generate the 2 keys in my local repo. To pair up with the remote repo in gitlab, we need to open the file .pub in text document and copy it into our gitlab project (Preferences/SSH Keys) Download the remote repository to our computer (creating a local repository), we need to clone it by using git clone url To get the URL, we need to go to our project created in gitlab, and copy it to the command In the Git CMD, I had trouble on pasting the SSH URL, so I tried with the HTTPS as suggested from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/54518 and it worked. After that, in our local repo, you will find a README text documentation, and that means we have successfully linked to the local repo from the remote repo. Now, we can add our index.html and styles.css to the local folder. Update the remote repo: any changes or modification from the local repo need to be updated so as to see in the remote repo. In the GIT CMD git status => to check the status of the remote repo git add . => to add any changes git commit -m \"message\" => to commit/confirm our modification git push => to update and move the changes to remote repo Host/Deploy our website in github I have been setting up using gitlab account, however, to facilitate the website deployment, we need to also set up CI/CD Pipelines which will help to automate our software delivery process. Unfortunately, gitlab will ask us to fill in our credit card information in order to use this function. It is a bit inconvenient for me to do so. Therefore, I will use github instead and set up from the beginning, but this time, we will write website using Markdowns (not HTML). Create new project in github Create new folder (local repository) for the website Copy the files template downloaded from the gitlab website (see the Markdown session below) to the local repo Remove the 2 files which we don\u2019t need for github Go to Docs to edit the index.html (home page) and other pages if you want Important tip - rename docs folder to _docs => anything we want to modify for our website in local repo will be excuted in this folder. - create new folder and name it: docs => do not touch this folder, this will store data generated from the remote repo. - open mkdocs.yml in notepad++ => change to relevant information, such as: site name\u2026 and especially docs_dir: change from \u201cdocs\u201d to \u201c_docs\u201d, and site_dir: change from \u201csite\u201d to \u201cdocs\u201d Push the local repo to the remote repo using the guideline below. Make sure you are in the correct directory of the website in command line After the git push, our remote repo should show the similar files as our local repo. At this stage, there will be one folder docs missing in the remote repo. Here, we need to go to the Setting in our github project, choose Pages Go to command line (not git cmd), tell the system to build docs file => type mkdocs build Git status Git add . Git commit Git push We will finally have linked the file \u201cdocs\u201d from local repo to remote repo Any modification is done later in local repo must be updated in remote repo following mkdocs build > git status > git add > git commit > git push.

Computer controlled cutting \u00b6 This week I worked on the processes involved in using vinyl cutter and laser cutter in Oulu Fablab. Aims \u00b6 Cut anything with vinyl cutter (Individual) Characterize laser cutter (Group) Make a parametric press-fit construction kit with laser cutter and demonstrate the process (Individual) Vinyl cutting \u00b6 Preparing the design \u00b6 I chose to use Inkscape for design preparation I firstly download my favorite image since I am not good at drawing https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/4988938-flying-beauty-pink-butterfly In the Inkscape, I go to Files > Import and choose the downloaded image Then I use trace bitmap in Inkscape because the vinyl cutter files must only contain vectors (and images we downloaded are mostly raster). So I will right click the image and select Trace bitmap, or go to tab Path > Trace bitmap, or Shift + Alt + B. In the pop-up window of Trace Bitmap, choose Edge detection, and it converts as below Next, I would need to draw a rectangle around the image as a frame. By doing this, it will be much easier for later peeling. Here I have problem when drawing a rectangle because it just showed the dot lines of the frame instead of the visible straight lines. So I tried to check the Fill and Stroke of the rectangle, and it should be flat color in stroke paint, and no color in Fill instead. Then I Ctrl A to choose all (a butterfly and a rectangle) and go to File > Document Properties > Resize page to drawing Next I need to configure the Fill and Stroke of the whole image (select all > click Object > Fill and Stroke) , I chose X (no color) for the Fill, Flat color for the Stroke paint, and 0.02mm width for the Stroke style Then this picture is ready to print. But I prepared it at home, so I need to copy it in .svg format to memory stick and go to Fablab to print Cutting with vinyl cutter \u00b6 At the University of Oulu, we use Roland CAMM-1 GS24 vinyl cutter. Characterizing laser cutter \u00b6 For understanding the nature and features of the laser cutter, as a group of four (Kecheng Zhang, Antti R, Antti Pantti and me), we worked mostly with Epilog Fusion M2 40 Laser 75 Watt which is larger than the other mini laser cutter. With the machine \u00b6 Turn on: there are 3 steps to turn on the machine Star cutting: assume that we have a design and already send to the machine, then we need adjust 3 things on the Joystick Control \u25cb JOG: (or the Origin) is where we set up the place/point where the machine begin to laser. By looking at the Red dot pointer and using the joystick to move it to the desired position \u25cb FOCUS: is where we decide the distance between the laser and the material we neet to cut. Normally, we have a special focusing tool (triangle shape) to support the adjustment. By installing the tool to the 2 knobs of the laser, and moving (up or down) the joystick until the tool touches the material, take out the tool after setting. \u25cb JOB: is where we choose the file we need to implement Remember that after each adjustment, we need to press the joystick so that the system can save our setting. After the 3 setting, the screen will display the amount of time spending for the job. Click GO to start cutting/engraving Important safety instructions: \u00b6 Since the laser cutter is the most dangerous machine in any Fablab, so we should: \u25cb NEVER Turn our back to the machine when it is cutting \u25cb Wait at least 1 minute after the machine finishes the cutting, and open the lid. Because the combution of some cutting materials may catch fire when exposing with air, so we need to wait for the exhaust pull away the gases \u25cb In case there is fire, (1) cover the place with the 'fire blanket' (near the sink in the Fablab), (2) bring the material out of the machine, (3) use the fire extinguisher. Kerf \u00b6 What is kerf: \u00b6 It is the width of material which is burned away. That mean the size of what we design to cut and of what we cut in reality will slightly mismatch. This happens because of many factors such as the laser beam has its own size, the nature of the materials, the environments, the settings, the process\u2026 It is important to take into consideration the kerf when designing, especially in parametric design. The picture from our instructor (Ms. Behnaz) is a good demonstration to understand. Measuring kerf \u00b6 To make it clearer, we prepared to cut the big rectangle with the length of 100 mm which has 10 small 10mm-rectangles inside. The file was saved in pdf format before sending to the laser cutter. The material we used to cut is MDF 3mm and Acryclic 3mm. Then we measured the size of the big one and the small onces after cutting to see the difference. To make it easy to calculate, we also used 2-side taps to help position the material on paper, and made use of the digital calculator. After cutting: Interestingly, both the MDF and the Acrylic demonstrated clearly the kerf. With MDF material: \u25a1 The designed size for the big rectangle we wanted to cut is 100 mm, but the real size is 100.03 mm. \u25a1 Similarly, 10 small rectangles were set to be 10 mm each (which accounted for 100 mm whole), but the value after cutting for 10 small rectangles together is 98.70 mm. \u25a1 Here we can see the gap, and the Kerf we calculated is 0.13 mm. With Acrylic material: we observed that actual size of the 10 small rectangles are 98.98mm. As such the Kerf is 0.102mm for this case. Power - Speed - Frequency - DPI \u00b6 For checking out the effect of Power, Speed, Frequency, DPI on the cutting/engraving quality, we used MDF 3mm and Acrylic 3mm to demonstrate this. With the MDF 3mm: Firstly, we keep the Frequency constant, and adjust the Power and Speed. Power | Speed | Freg | Observation :------:|:-------:|:------:|:------------| 100 |15 |20 |Cut thru| 100 |5 |20 |Cut thru but very slow| 100 |40 |20 |Not cut thru due to fast speed| 50 |15 |20 |Not cut thru due to too low evergy| 80 |15 |20 |Cut thru| We observed that with slow speed, the machine works well in cutting through the material, while if we set the machine run fast, it hardly to cut. Additionally, with low power(50) MDF 3mm cannot be cut cannot cut but we can make use of this figure to engrave for example. Interestingly, with just 80% power, the square can be cut easily, which is a good consideration for power saving. Next, we adjusted the frequency and keep the power (100) and speed (15) constant to see what would happen. The frequency was change from 20, 5, 40, 60, 80 but there were not so many differnces we could observe,because all were well-cut To check the engraving quality, we kept the Speed (50) and DPI (300) unchanged while adjusted the Power (from 20, 50, and 100). It is also important to note that the color of all 3 pictures should be the same or else it will not describe correctly the effect. It can be clearly seen that with less power, the engraved parts are lighter than those of strong power. \u00b6 Making with laser cutter \u00b6","title":"4.

So I will right click the image and select Trace bitmap, or go to tab Path > Trace bitmap, or Shift + Alt + B. In the pop-up window of Trace Bitmap, choose Edge detection, and it converts as below Next, I would need to draw a rectangle around the image as a frame. By doing this, it will be much easier for later peeling. Here I have problem when drawing a rectangle because it just showed the dot lines of the frame instead of the visible straight lines. So I tried to check the Fill and Stroke of the rectangle, and it should be flat color in stroke paint, and no color in Fill instead. Then I Ctrl A to choose all (a butterfly and a rectangle) and go to File > Document Properties > Resize page to drawing Next I need to configure the Fill and Stroke of the whole image (select all > click Object > Fill and Stroke) , I chose X (no color) for the Fill, Flat color for the Stroke paint, and 0.02mm width for the Stroke style Then this picture is ready to print.

Then we measured the size of the big one and the small onces after cutting to see the difference. To make it easy to calculate, we also used 2-side taps to help position the material on paper, and made use of the digital calculator. After cutting: Interestingly, both the MDF and the Acrylic demonstrated clearly the kerf. With MDF material: \u25a1 The designed size for the big rectangle we wanted to cut is 100 mm, but the real size is 100.03 mm. \u25a1 Similarly, 10 small rectangles were set to be 10 mm each (which accounted for 100 mm whole), but the value after cutting for 10 small rectangles together is 98.70 mm. \u25a1 Here we can see the gap, and the Kerf we calculated is 0.13 mm. With Acrylic material: we observed that actual size of the 10 small rectangles are 98.98mm.
