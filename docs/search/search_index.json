Project management \u00b6 2nd day of week 1, I worked on configuring HTML, VCS (GITLAB, GITHUB) and started to get used to the documentation process. To be honest, I did not get familiar with the term \u201cdocumentation\u201d, because in my faculty, we usually use \u201clearning journal\u201d instead. Therefore, if you have similar feeling, you can think it simply as document or make diary of whatever you have learnt. Another thing is that, while studying the materials/ watching tutorials, I usually used screen-capture and pasted all the photos into my Onenote for later easy documentation. HTML, CSS, JavaScript \u00b6 Normally, a website includes 3 main parts: HTML (content and structure), CSS (style, e.g. colors, elements positions, and text sizes) and Javascript (provide interaction with the users) 1.HTML The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Wikipedia . To create a basic website, all we need is a basic text editor (such as Notepad, or Notepad ++). Of course we can consider other applications including: Sublime text, Visual studio go, Brackets\u2026 Once having a text editor installed in your laptop, we need to know about the Anatomy of HTML elements https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started (which look like syntax with heading and ending signal) and write what we want to show in our website. I wrote my first website in the Notepad ++ and named it \u201cindex.html\u201d in website interface, it looks like this 2.CSS Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. wikipedia . To create style for what we wrote, we need to have another text document featuring the styles we want. For example, I want my header will be in red. I will write the rule like this to a new text document, and name it styles.css h1 { color: red; } To link the style to index.html, we need to write a rule inside the of our index.html and it will show in website as below 3.JavaScript would not be our focus in this course but it is about the interactions/behaviors for users such as a list down menu\u2026 VCS (Version Control System) - Gitlab vs Github \u00b6 VCS is a software which records changes, permits recall older versions, and enables collaboration. Among VCS softwares, we choose GIT (https://git-scm.com/) due to its free, simple, fast, and open VCS platform. As learnt, there are 3 popular code hosting sites: GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab. In this course, we focus more on GitHub and GitLab which are both web-based GIT repository hosting service with distributed revision control and social features. Since the main aim of this week is to have my own website deployed in class repository (either gitlab or github) , so we need to do following steps: Create an account in gitlab or github and create a new project . This will be the place we host our website. In my case, I first chose GitLab to be my GIT repository manager. Setup GIT in my computer (install GIT from https://git-scm.com/downloads , and configure git with my name and email address Generate SSH keys : we need these keys to authenticate ourselves with the system so that it knows we are the one who owns the project. We have 2 types of SSH keys: private key (which will store in our local file), and public key (which everyone can see and get) To create SSH keys: I type the command ssh-keygen -t rsa -C \u201cyour.email@example.com\u201d -b 4096 into the Git CMD Then it will generate the 2 keys in my ssh configuration folder. To pair up with the remote repo in gitlab, we need to open the file .pub in text document and copy it into our gitlab project (Preferences/SSH Keys) Download the remote repository to our computer (creating a local repository), we need to clone it by using git clone url To get the URL, we need to go to our project created in gitlab, and copy it to the command In the Git CMD, I had trouble on pasting the SSH URL, so I tried with the HTTPS as suggested from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/54518 and it worked. After that, in our local repo, you will find a README text documentation, and that means we have successfully linked to the local repo from the remote repo. Now, we can add our index.html and styles.css to the local folder. Update the remote repo : any changes or modification from the local repo need to be updated so as to see in the remote repo. In the GIT CMD git status => to check the status of the remote repo. git add . => to append one or more files to the commit that is being created. git commit -m \"message\" => to store the commit in local repo. git push => to update and move the changes to remote repo. Host/Deploy my website in GitHub I have been setting up using gitlab account, however, to facilitate the website deployment, we need to also set up CI/CD Pipelines which will help to automate our software delivery process. Unfortunately, gitlab will ask us to fill in our credit card information in order to use this function. It is a bit inconvenient for me to do so. Therefore, I will I will choose GitHub as my code hosting site instead, which mean I have to set up all the things from the beginning (step 1,3&4), and create my website using Markdowns (not HTML). Create a new folder in my computer (local repository) for the website, here I named it as fablabcoursehub Setup a new account and create a new repository (namedly my_website ) in GitHub Generate SSH Keys in GitHub to authenticate myself with the system: in the my_website remote repo, go to Setting (at the top right corner of the web) > choose SSH and GPG Keys > New SSH Key I type the title for the key as fablabprojectmanagementkey and copy the SSH key that I created above (3) to share it with GitHub and click SSH Key. Download the remote repo: in the newly created repository my_website , go to Code > choose SSH > copy the key URL > in the command line: type git clone and paste the key in After the successful cloning, in my local repository fablabcoursehub , there is a folder named my_website Building a website with Markdown - MKDOCS \u00b6 The website I am going to build is a static web which is built with much simple codes/language, allow simple navigation \u2026 in comparison to dynamic web Wiki As such, a static web generator is needed. In my case, I will use MkDocs , which is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that\u2019s geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown , which is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. Wiki First, since mkdocs requires Python (or pip), so I need to install the recent version of Python and then install mkdocs package using pip, following the detailed guidelines Then I will copy the website template downloaded from the Fabacademy_oulu to my local repo (folder my_website ) I remove the 2 files which I don\u2019t need for GitHub Important note before starting to edit the web rename docs folder to _docs => anything we want to modify for our website in local repo will be excuted in this folder. create new folder and name it: docs => do not touch this folder, this will store data generated from the remote repo. open mkdocs.yml in notepad++ => change to relevant information, such as: site name\u2026 and especially docs_dir: change from \u201cdocs\u201d to \u201c_docs\u201d, and site_dir: change from \u201csite\u201d to \u201cdocs\u201d Push the local repo to the remote repo using the guideline below.

Computer Aided design \u00b6 In this week, I have been introduced various types of computer-aided design tools for making 2D and 3D prototypes. Aim of this week \u00b6 Evaluate and select 2D and 3D software. Demonstrate and describe processes used in modelling with 2D and 3D software eg. 2D raster, 2D vector and 3D modelling processes. Model (raster, vector, 2D, 3D, render, animate, simulate, \u2026) a possible final project, compress images and videos. 2D Design \u00b6 There are 2 types of 2D graphics: raster graphics and vector graphics. While raster images are in pixels, vector graphics are in geometric primitives (lines, curves) Most photos are in raster images (tiff, jpeg, gif, pcx, bmp), vector graphics are usually in ai, eps, svg, pdf format. With processing 2D graphics, I have explored GIMP & INKSCAPE software. GIMP \u00b6 I have designed a snowflake using GIMP following https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VWn1qO0irE Create a new image, remmember to set the view Show grid for better calculation Choose ellipse to draw a circle and check on the option of Expand from center Choose Paintbrush tool/Pencil , and its color (I chose purple) to draw the first line vertically from the center. To make it straight, draw a dot in the center, press shift , then draw to the edge of the circle Press shift+R to open a Rotate , input 30 to the Angle because I would like to make a snowflake with 12 petals. Do the same for 11 remaining petals In layer , choose to create a new layer (I named it layer 1), remmember to choose Fill with transparency Draw a new circle and 3 lines overlapped with the previous lines but with black color Choose Paintbrush tool/Pencil with different sizes and mark on the black lines. This will later create a shape of a snowflake petals Choose Erase tool and its size to remove/sharpen the petals After removing the previous layer (layer with purple lines), we have a snowflake as below. INKSCAPE \u00b6 I used Inkscape to create my sticker. Firstly, I downloaded a picture from the internet https://www.wallpaperbetter.com/en/hd-wallpaper-gbnmu Then I imported it to Inkscape Because I only want to get the fish next to the mermaid, so I right-clicked to the picture and chose Trace bitmap. By using this, I could detect the edge in \u201cSingle scan\u201d option, and remove background in \u201cMultiple scans\u201d option. I pressed Apply and got the result with black and white characters. I then went to Path > Break apart to scatter the big pictures to smaller ones. This will allow me to see all the details of the fish and choose to group the correct ones. I selected all elements of the fish and clicked Object to setup the \u201cFill and Stroke* Then I drew a circle around the fish and chose the corresponding Fill and Stroke* After that, I selected Text to type what I wanted for the sticker, and chose Text > Put on path to connect the text with the circle. Finally, I selected the desired direction for the text to be in the cirle. Overall, I find using Inkscape is a bit more convenient and easier to understand for me, because to this level, I don\u2019t have to deal with some kinds of layer (as in GIMP) which sometime confused me. 3D Design \u00b6 Fusion 360 \u00b6 I experienced with Fusion 360 on modeling a base to fit on the handlebar (of a bike) so as to keep the flashlight In Fusion360, I create sketch and choose the Top surface. In the Create tab, I choose to draw a rectangle (90x50mm) Then I choose Fit point spline to create a slot on the retangle\u2019s length. I use Trim to cut the inner side of the slot I continue to draw another small circle (18mm in diameter) to the other side of the rectangle, and use Trim to remove the inner side Finally, I finish the sketch and Extrude it to 3D. To be honest, it was my first time working on Fusion 360, so it was quite a bit confused in selecting different functions/shapes. Also, for me, the hardest part is the ability to imagine different perspectives or surface so as to draw the desired shape (for example, what it will look like from the back, top, or the front) Origin files \u00b6 2D Sknowflake design 2D Fish design 3D design","title":"3.

Overall, I find using Inkscape is a bit more convenient and easier to understand for me, because to this level, I don\u2019t have to deal with some kinds of layer (as in GIMP) which sometime confused me.","title":"INKSCAPE"},{"location":"assignments/week03/#3d-design","text":"","title":"3D Design"},{"location":"assignments/week03/#fusion-360","text":"I experienced with Fusion 360 on modeling a base to fit on the handlebar (of a bike) so as to keep the flashlight In Fusion360, I create sketch and choose the Top surface.

Computer controlled cutting \u00b6 This week I worked on the processes involved in using vinyl cutter and laser cutter in Oulu Fablab. Aims \u00b6 Cut anything with vinyl cutter (Individual) Characterize laser cutter (Group) Make a parametric press-fit construction kit with laser cutter and demonstrate the process (Individual) Vinyl cutting \u00b6 Preparing the design \u00b6 I chose to use Inkscape for design preparation I firstly download my favorite image since I am not good at drawing https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/4988938-flying-beauty-pink-butterfly In the Inkscape, I go to Files > Import and choose the downloaded image Then I use trace bitmap in Inkscape because the vinyl cutter files must only contain vectors (and images we downloaded are mostly raster). So I will right click the image and select Trace bitmap, or go to tab Path > Trace bitmap, or Shift + Alt + B. In the pop-up window of Trace Bitmap, choose Edge detection, and it converts as below Next, I would need to draw a rectangle around the image as a frame. By doing this, it will be much easier for later peeling. Here I have problem when drawing a rectangle because it just showed the dot lines of the frame instead of the visible straight lines. So I tried to check the Fill and Stroke of the rectangle, and it should be flat color in stroke paint, and no color in Fill instead. Then I Ctrl A to choose all (a butterfly and a rectangle) and go to File > Document Properties > Resize page to drawing Next I need to configure the Fill and Stroke of the whole image (select all > click Object > Fill and Stroke) , I chose X (no color) for the Fill, Flat color for the Stroke paint, and 0.02mm width for the Stroke style Then this picture is ready to print. But I prepared it at home, so I need to copy it in .svg format to memory stick and go to Fablab to print Cutting with vinyl cutter \u00b6 At the University of Oulu, we use Roland CAMM-1 GS24 vinyl cutter. Loading lever: we push it to the back to load the sheet and adjust the rollers, and pull it to the front to fix the position to cut. Remember that the lever should be in the front position (we can view as locked) when cutting. White strips are places where we should place the rollers. There are 2 rollers which play as positioning the width of the sheet. Cutting carriage: there is a very small blade installed here. The cutting will move from left to right to cut. Operation Panel (on the right of the machine): there are 3 selections available for material a) roll:the machine will measure the distance between the rollers and is mostly used for the rolling cutting sheet b) piece: the machine will measure length and width of the sheet and c) edge: the machine will measure the distance between the rollers and moves the blade to the left edge of the sheet. For setting the vinyl cutter for my image, I first loaded the sheet under the rollers Then I chose Edge on the Operation Panel, and press OK. The machine will show \u201cNow loading\u201d which means it will start to measure my sheet. After measuring, it shows the Width as 418mm. Back to the computer, I opened my image in Inskcape. Here I pressed Ctrl P, and chose Printing Properties > Get from the Machine , it will show the same number as shown on the vinyl cutter. This way is useful to get to know the size of the sheet we want to cut. Later, back to the main screen of Inkscape, I moved my image to CutStudio by choosing Extention tab > Roland CutStudio > Open in CutStudio. In CutStudio, I pressed Ctr P to print (remember to choose the correct cutting machine) Back to the Operation Panel, I pressed Enter to start cutting. Actually, we can choose to print/cut directly from the Inkscape, but as my experience, the CutStudio makes it more convenient. Since the image I chose has so many small details, and the lines are so close to each others, the machine somehow peeled it while cutting. I would better choose another good example to demonstrate the vinyl cutting later, now I just sticked with it and try to peel it (I used a tweezer to help me). You can see some details in my cutting have to be sacrified. After removing the unwanted parts, I used a piece of paper adhesive sheet to help moving my sticker to the desired place I sticked it on my laptop Apparently, we should consider the details of our image when vinyl cutting. So this time, I chose another better one, and repeated the above steps Characterizing laser cutter \u00b6 For understanding the nature and features of the laser cutter, as a group of four (Kecheng Zhang, Antti R, Antti Pantti and me), we worked mostly with Epilog Fusion M2 40 Laser 75 Watt which is larger than the other mini laser cutter. With the machine \u00b6 Turn on: there are 3 steps to turn on the machine Start cutting: assume that we have a design and already send to the machine, then we need adjust 3 things on the Joystick Control \u25cb JOG: is where we set up the *origin* or the place/point where the machine begins to laser. By looking at the Red dot pointer and using the joystick to move it to the desired position \u25cb FOCUS: is where we decide the distance between the laser and the material we neet to cut. Normally, we have a special focusing tool (triangle shape) to support the adjustment. By installing the tool to the 2 knobs of the laser, and moving (up or down) the joystick until the tool touches the material, take out the tool after setting. \u25cb JOB: is where we choose the file we need to implement Remember that after each adjustment of the JOG and FOCUS, we need to press the joystick so that the system can save our setting. After the 3 setting, the screen will display the amount of time spending for the job. Click GO to start cutting/engraving Important safety instructions: \u00b6 Since the laser cutter is the most dangerous machine in any Fablab, so we should: \u25cb NEVER Turn our back to the machine when it is cutting \u25cb Wait at least 1 minute after the machine finishes the cutting, and open the lid. Because the combution of some cutting materials may catch fire when exposing with air, so we need to wait for the exhaust pull away the gases \u25cb In case there is fire, (1) cover the place with the 'fire blanket' (near the sink in the Fablab), (2) bring the material out of the machine, (3) use the fire extinguisher. Kerf \u00b6 What is kerf: \u00b6 It is the width of material which is burned away. That means the size of what we design to cut and of what we cut in reality will slightly mismatch. This happens because of many factors such as the laser beam has its own size, the nature of the materials, the environments, the settings, the process\u2026 It is important to take into consideration the kerf when designing, especially in parametric design. The picture from our instructor (Ms. Behnaz) is a good demonstration to understand. Measuring kerf \u00b6 To make it clearer, we prepared to cut the big rectangle with the length of 100 mm which has 10 small 10mm-rectangles inside. The file was saved in pdf format before sending to the laser cutter. The material we used to cut is MDF 3mm and Acryclic 3mm. Then we measured the size of the big one and the small onces after cutting to see the difference. To make it easy to calculate, we also used 2-side taps to help position the material on paper, and made use of the digital caliper. After cutting: Interestingly, both the MDF and the Acrylic demonstrated clearly the kerf. With MDF material: \u25a1 The designed size for the big rectangle we wanted to cut is 100 mm, but the real size is 100.03 mm. \u25a1 Similarly, 10 small rectangles were set to be 10 mm each (which accounted for 100 mm whole), but the value after cutting for 10 small rectangles together is 98.70 mm. \u25a1 Here we can see the gap, and the Kerf we calculated is 0.13 mm. With Acrylic material: we observed that actual size of the 10 small rectangles are 98.98mm. As such the Kerf is 0.102mm for this case. Power - Speed - Frequency - DPI \u00b6 For checking out the effect of Power, Speed, Frequency, DPI on the cutting/engraving quality, we used MDF 3mm and Acrylic 3mm to demonstrate this. With the MDF 3mm: Firstly, we keep the Frequency constant, and adjust the Power and Speed. Power Speed Freg Observation 100 15 20 Cut thru 100 5 20 Cut thru but very slow 100 40 20 Not cut thru due to fast speed 50 15 20 Not cut thru due to too low evergy 80 15 20 Cut thru We observed that with slow speed, the machine works well in cutting through the material, while being set to run in fast speed, the MDF is hardly to cut. Additionally, with low power (50) MDF 3mm cannot be cut but we can make use of this figure to engrave, for example. Interestingly, with just 80% power, the square can be cut easily, which is a good consideration for power saving. Next, we adjusted the frequency and keep the power (100) and speed (15) constant to see what would happen. The frequency was changed from 20, 5, 40, 60, 80 but there were not so many differences we could observe, because all were well-cut. To check the engraving quality, we kept the Speed (50) and DPI (300) unchanged while adjusted the Power (from 20, 50, and 100). It is also important to note that the color of all 3 pictures should be the same or else it will not describe correctly the effect. It can be clearly seen that with less power, the engraved parts are lighter than those of strong power. With the Acrylic 3mm: we changed the default value since the material is different compared to the MDF 3mm. However the result is quite similar to what demonstrated with MDF 3mm For checking the Focus , we set up the rastering as in focused, 2mm above the focused, 2mm below the focused, 4mm above the focused, and 4mm below the focused. The result has shown that it was a big different between the below/above focus and the in-focused (as we can see the engraved color in the in-focused is much darker). However, among those below and above focus, the engraving color look quite similar. Making with laser cutter \u00b6 In this assignment, I have to design and make a press-fit construction kit by my own. Most importantly, it should be parametric design without using Inkscape. So that means I have to consider using 3D design software which is quite challenging for me as a newbie within a week. However, I decided to use Autodesk Fusion 360 since I already asked for the student account installation. Anyway, with the support of my instructors and peers, I did it and can finally create a nice thing. Sketch a design \u00b6 I firstly drew on paper what I wanted to make, and it is a pen holder. It will have 4 pillars (in rectangle-shape) to hold 4 disks (in circular-shape) with inside empty and 1 disk as a base. Design on Fusion 360 \u00b6 I click on Create sketch and choose a surface I want to draw. It was a TOP In the Create , I choose a circle shape. It will then appear a small window of Sketch palette on the right hand, and I choose Center diameter circle to draw a circle from the central point. I input the diameter of the circle as 100mm . Then I draw another smaller circle inside with 70mm in diameter. In the Create , I choose to draw Rectangle (2-point rectangle) inside the big circle. This will be made as a joint in a press-fit construction later. I temporarily set the height as 8mm and width as 3mm. I need to define my own parameter so that it will be more convenient if later I want to change some dimensions which related to each other, they will be changed accordingly. I go to Modify , select Change Parameters , click + and define parameter in my own words. I especially choose the Material_thickness as 3mm because I plan to cut in the MDF 3mm. For the Kerf , I define it as 0.1mm because as we test above, the kerf for cutting joint slot with MDF 3mm is around 0.13mm. We can change it later if after cutting it does not fit. I also define the slot_width =Material_thickness-Kerf. After clicking OK to set the parameters, I go back to the sketch and change the name of the dimensions. By double click on the dimensions, for example the 8mm of the slot, I will type slot_height. I do the same for the other dimensions (big_cirle, small_circle, slot_width) Next, to make a slot, I need to Trim or remove (click on the scissor shape) the unnecessary parts of the rectangle. I need to make the slot height constrainted to make sure they will always fix and position. So in the tab Constraint , I choose the icon of equal (=), and click the 2 sides of the slot. Now I have 2 circles and a slot with constraint. It is nearly similar to my sketch, except I need 3 more slots. So here the instructor advices me to use a tool called Circular Pattern in the Create tab. This function will allow us to duplicate the sketch in an arc or circular pattern As a Circular pattern window pops up, I do step by step as the guideline. First, for the Object , I select the 3 sides of the slot. Second, for the Center Point , I select the big circle. Then, I select Full for the Angular Spacing because I want the slots go around the circle. Finally, I choose 4 for the Quantity Now I have 4 slots on the big circle. But at the 3 new slots we need to trim the unwanted parts on the cirle to make it a slot. Since I make constraint for the first slot, so other slots duplicated from that will also constraint. To check that, I go to Change parameters and change the slot height as 9mm. When I back to the sketch, the slot height of other slot is also changed to 9mm (click on the height, press D - as Measurement, and drag it to see) Now I move on to draw another part (a pillar for the pen holder). I draw a rectangle with 25mm width and 150mm height On this rectangle, I also need to have slots (5 in total). So the steps will be quite similar as making slots for the circle above. I first draw a small rectangle, but this time, I put the name of the parameter I define before to the dimensions instead of the number. Then I do the Trim for the small rectangle to make a slot. To duplicate the slot, I will use the same tip as above, but this time with Rectangular Pattern In the rectangular pattern windown: For the Object , I select the 3 sides of the slot. Second, for the Direction , I select left side of the big rectangle. Then, I input 5 for the 1st Quantity because I want 5 slots. Then for the Distance, I am not quite sure, so I use the blue arrow appeared on the sketch and move it to the position I find comfortable. For the 2nd Quantity , it is the number of rectangles will be duplicated in the horizon direction, I don\u2019t need more than 1, so I put it 1. Now I have 5 rectangles on the pillar, just need to trim to make them slots. And finish the design Export to PDF with Fusion 360 \u00b6 To export to PDF, I need to Extrude the sketch to 3D. I click on Finish Sketch , and select all (both the cirle and the rectangle pillar). Then I go to Create and choose Extrude . Here it will ask to input the thickness of my 3D, so I type 3 because the material I will use to cut is MDF 3mm. In the Design tab, I choose Drawing > From Design , and it will pop up a Create Drawing window, in which I select the Sheet size as A4 In the Drawing view , I change the Orientation to the Top and the Scale to 1:1 . Place the mouse to the drawing and OK. To delete the outside frame and the title frame of the drawing, I go to Sheet setting and click on the eyes to make it invisible. Now I will export to PDF and save it. Prepare to print with Inkscape \u00b6 In the Inkscape, I import the pdf file, and set up the Fill and Sroke of the objects (Fill: no paint, Stroke paint: Flat color, Stroke styles: 0.02 mm). It is not allowed to change the size in Inkscape because it will affect to the kerf and other dimensions. Then, I will save it again in PDF. Set up with laser cutter \u00b6 I open the newly saved PDF and press Ctrl P. In the Epilog Properties, Advanced tab, I select the parameter for the materials 3mm_MDF_cut and press OK to send the job to the laser cutter Back to the laser cutter, I adjust the Jog, Focus, and Job. It was so satisfied to see my design is coming true. After that, I test the joints connection and see they fix quite well. So I decide to make more by copying the images in Inkscape, and do again with the Fill and Strokes\u2026 Additionally, I would need to have another circle as a base (without being empty inside), so I back to my sketch in Fusion 360, select the smaller circle and extrude it. Then I export it to PDF, adjust the Fill and Stroke in Inkscape, Save in PDF, and send to laser cutter to print. Assemble the construction kit \u00b6 Now I have all objects I need and it is time for assemblingggg It can hold the pens or \u201cassemble other ways\u201d by connecting with other press-fit construction kits Original Designed files \u00b6 3D Pressfit design 2D Pressfit 1 2D Pressfit 2 3D Pressfit 1 universal ver 3D Pressfit 2 universal ver Butterfly vinyl cut Owl vinyl cut","title":"4.

I need to make the slot height constrainted to make sure they will always fix and position. So in the tab Constraint , I choose the icon of equal (=), and click the 2 sides of the slot. Now I have 2 circles and a slot with constraint. It is nearly similar to my sketch, except I need 3 more slots. So here the instructor advices me to use a tool called Circular Pattern in the Create tab. This function will allow us to duplicate the sketch in an arc or circular pattern As a Circular pattern window pops up, I do step by step as the guideline. First, for the Object , I select the 3 sides of the slot. Second, for the Center Point , I select the big circle. Then, I select Full for the Angular Spacing because I want the slots go around the circle. Finally, I choose 4 for the Quantity Now I have 4 slots on the big circle. But at the 3 new slots we need to trim the unwanted parts on the cirle to make it a slot. Since I make constraint for the first slot, so other slots duplicated from that will also constraint. To check that, I go to Change parameters and change the slot height as 9mm. When I back to the sketch, the slot height of other slot is also changed to 9mm (click on the height, press D - as Measurement, and drag it to see) Now I move on to draw another part (a pillar for the pen holder). I draw a rectangle with 25mm width and 150mm height On this rectangle, I also need to have slots (5 in total). So the steps will be quite similar as making slots for the circle above. I first draw a small rectangle, but this time, I put the name of the parameter I define before to the dimensions instead of the number. Then I do the Trim for the small rectangle to make a slot. To duplicate the slot, I will use the same tip as above, but this time with Rectangular Pattern In the rectangular pattern windown: For the Object , I select the 3 sides of the slot. Second, for the Direction , I select left side of the big rectangle. Then, I input 5 for the 1st Quantity because I want 5 slots. Then for the Distance, I am not quite sure, so I use the blue arrow appeared on the sketch and move it to the position I find comfortable. For the 2nd Quantity , it is the number of rectangles will be duplicated in the horizon direction, I don\u2019t need more than 1, so I put it 1. Now I have 5 rectangles on the pillar, just need to trim to make them slots. And finish the design","title":"Design on Fusion 360"},{"location":"assignments/week04/#export-to-pdf-with-fusion-360","text":"To export to PDF, I need to Extrude the sketch to 3D. I click on Finish Sketch , and select all (both the cirle and the rectangle pillar). Then I go to Create and choose Extrude . Here it will ask to input the thickness of my 3D, so I type 3 because the material I will use to cut is MDF 3mm. In the Design tab, I choose Drawing > From Design , and it will pop up a Create Drawing window, in which I select the Sheet size as A4 In the Drawing view , I change the Orientation to the Top and the Scale to 1:1 . Place the mouse to the drawing and OK. To delete the outside frame and the title frame of the drawing, I go to Sheet setting and click on the eyes to make it invisible.

Invention, intellectual property and income \u00b6 This week I have learnt about difference among licenses (patent, copyright, trademark) and the development of any possible business idea for the product I want to make. Assignment: Develop a plan for dissemination of your final project. Prepare drafts of your summary slide (presentation.png, 1920x1080) and video clip (presentation.mp4, 1080p HTML5, < ~minute, < ~10 MB) and put them in your root directory Motivation behind the product \u00b6 My starting point for my product is just aimed to fulfill my personal need. I am actually quite curious of the saying that Oulu is famous as a winter cycling city. Therefore, despite the advices from my family and friends back home that it is very dangerous when biking in winter, with curiosity and advanterous characteristics, I bought myself a second-hand bike and took the first tour around. Then I realized people here when riding, they have equipped themselves many accessories such as reflector, vest, flashlight in the front and back\u2026 so as to be seen in the dark. In which I think the most important is the flashlight. When I moved to Oulu, I have brought myself a good flashlight from my hometown, so I want to make use of it. However, there is nothing to attach and secure it to the front of my bike. I know that I can use some kind of rubber band, but obviously it does not look good. As such, I think of making \u201ca thing\u201d secured on the bike and help holding my flashlight. Moreover, I love photographing and recording every beautiful road and moments I have been through. Therefore I also think of integrating into \u201cmy product other functions/mechanism/design to hold phone or camera or even Gopro. Dissemination plan \u00b6 Actually, besides my product could fulfill my personal need, when thinking of the prospective future of it, I believe it also has a potential to go on a business because of its functionalities. Firstly, it can be seen clearly that every biker would need it because it is convenient, helpful and compact ( 4 in 1 : holding flashlight, phone, camera, Gopro). Secondly, target group is also large, which can range from students with limited budget, food-delivering staff with the need to use phone almost everytime (for searching map, or checking orders\u2026), to vbloggers \u2026 Finally, with the market share on wide range of users, companies doing business related to bicycle can consider it as an add-on or accessories. To disseminate the product, I think: Phase 1: I would post / share and survey it within the biker community to get it tested. Phase 2: after the product has been finished and adjusted accordingly, it can be introduced to some bike shops or supermartkets like sampling or pre-launching. Phase 3: if the feedback is good, I can collaborate with some designers to make it more attractive and fashionable, and maybe some manufacturers for mass production. Licenses \u00b6 I think my idea is not novel because it is more likely the combination of what we already have (rubber band, selfie stick, tripod). Therefore, I would love to share the idea to other people and would be glad if others could remix and re-design it effeciently. Apart from that, I would like to have some kind of acknowledgement or credit (such as mentioning my name) if my idea is being used.

As such, I think of making \u201ca thing\u201d (temporary namedly \u201cKokippu\u201d) secured on the bike handlebar with its main function is to hold necessary things for biker, for example: flashlight, phone, camera, Gopro. In addition, the product could be developed further to have a charging function for electronic devices it is holding. My idea is that a small solar power bank can be integrated into the Kokippu, and its power will be utilized to charge phone/cam/flashlight on the ride. However, this idea may face challenges in certain areas where sunlight is limited like Finland. So I also think of using dynamo power bank instead. Moreover, a small sensor might be installed to Kokippu so as to detect the level of the power bank (e.g.: when it is full or is going to run out) Actually, besides the product could fulfill my personal need, I guess it also meets others\u2019 demand. It can be seen clearly that every biker would need it because it is convenient, helpful and compact ( 4 in 1 : holding flashlight, phone, camera, Gopro). Students with limited budget would love to use it to hang their existing normal flashlight (at home), without having to spend too much on buying too many accessories such as special flashlight for bike. Food-delivering staff with the need to use phone almost everytime such as for searching map, or checking orders\u2026, would use it more often because it helps them hand-free to follow the map while keep riding. Vloggers who love to capture and record as much as possible all of the moments would find it useful, since they can hang their phone/cam on the bike and turn it on while still riding, speaking and enjoying the scene","title":"Final Project - Initial idea"},{"location":"projects/final-project/#final-project-initial-idea","text":"Getting inspired when riding a bike around Oulu these days, I come up with an idea to make a tool which will be mounted on the front of the bike (bike handlebar) to keep various things such as flashlight, phone, camera\u2026 Although definitely, I know that I can use some kind of rubber band to help keeping those things, but obviously it does not look good.
