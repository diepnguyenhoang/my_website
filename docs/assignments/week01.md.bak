# 1. Principles and practices

## Course introduction
The course is designed for beginners who would like to emerge to digital fabrication. As such, we will learn about Project management and Introduction to 2D and 3D design tools.

> Fab labs are a global network of local labs, enabling invention by providing access to tools for digital fabrication.



This session is mainly inherented from the FabAacademy. Especially, in the lecture of MIT prof. Neil Gershenfeld., I found it interesting in the way he presented

## Assignment for this course

- Plan and sketch a potential final project. The requirements for the final project are:
- Create your own integrated design
- Demonstrate 2D & 3D modelling capabilities applied to your own designs
- Select and apply appropriate additive and subtractive techniques
- Demonstrate competence in design, fabrication and programming of your own fabbed microcontroller PCB, including an input & output device
