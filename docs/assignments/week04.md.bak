# 4. Computer controlled cutting

This week I worked on the processes involved in using vinyl cutter and laser cutter in Oulu Fablab.

# Aims

- Cut anything with vinyl cutter (Individual)
- Characterize laser cutter (Group)
- Make a parametric press-fit construction kit with laser cutter and demonstrate the process (Individual)


## Vinyl cutting



### Preparing the design
I chose to use Inkscape for design preparation
- I firstly download my favorite image since I am not good at drawing (https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/4988938-flying-beauty-pink-butterfly)
- In the Inkscape, I go to *Files > Import* and choose the downloaded image 
- Then I use *trace bitmap* in Inkscape because the vinyl cutter files must only contain vectors (and images we downloaded are mostly raster). So I will right click the image and select Trace bitmap, or go to tab Path > Trace bitmap, or Shift + Alt + B. In the pop-up window of Trace Bitmap, choose Edge detection, and it converts as below

- Next, I would need to *draw a rectangle* around the image as a frame. By doing this, it will be much easier for later peeling. Here I have problem when drawing a rectangle because it just showed the dot lines of the frame instead of the visible straight lines. So I tried to check the *Fill and Stroke* of the rectangle, and it should be flat color in stroke paint, and no color in Fill instead.

- Then I *Ctrl A* to choose all (a butterfly and a rectangle) and go to File > Document Properties > Resize page to drawing

- Next I need to configure the Fill and Stroke of the whole image (select all > click Object > Fill and Stroke) , I chose X (no color) for the Fill, Flat color for the Stroke paint, and 0.02mm width for the Stroke style

Then this picture is ready to print. But I prepared it at home, so I need to copy it in .svg format to memory stick and go to Fablab to print

### Cutting with vinyl cutter

At the University of Oulu, we use  Roland CAMM-1 GS24 vinyl cutter.




## Characterizing laser cutter

For understanding the nature and features of the laser cutter, as a group, we worked mostly with Epilog Fusion M2 40 Laser 75 Watt which is larger than the other mini laser cutter.

### With the machine

- Turn on: there are 3 steps to turn on the machine

- Star cutting: assume that we have a design and already send to the machine, then we need adjust 3 things on the Joystick Control

		○ JOG: (or the Origin)  is where we set up the place/point where the machine begin to laser. By looking at the Red dot pointer and using the joystick to move it to the desired position
		
		○ FOCUS: is where we decide the distance between the laser and the material we neet to cut. Normally, we have a special focusing tool (triangle shape) to support the adjustment. By installing the tool to the 2 knobs of the laser, and moving (up or down) the joystick until the tool touches the material, take out the tool after setting.
		
		○ JOB: is where we choose the file we need to implement 

- Remember that after each adjustment, we need to press the joystick so that the system can save our setting.

- After the 3 setting, the screen will display the amount of time spending for the job.

- Click GO to start cutting/engraving
	
### Important safety instructions: 


```
Since the laser cutter is the most dangerous machine in any Fablab, so we should:
○ NEVER Turn our back to the machine when it is cutting
○ Wait at least 1 minute after the machine finishes the cutting, and open the lid. Because the combution of some cutting materials may catch fire when exposing with air, so we need to wait for the exhaust pull away the gases
○ In case there is fire, (1) cover the place with the 'fire blanket' (near the sink in the Fablab), (2) bring the material out of the machine, (3) use the fire extinguisher.
```

### Kerf

#### What is kerf: 
It is the width of material which is burned away. That mean the size of what we design to cut and of what we cut in reality will slightly mismatch. This happens because of many factors such as the laser beam has its own size, the nature of the materials, the environments, the settings, the process… It is important to take into consideration the kerf when designing, especially in parametric design.
The picture from our instructor (Ms. Behnaz) is a good demonstration to understand.

#### Measuring kerf
- To make it clearer, we prepared to cut the big rectangle with the length of 100 mm which has 10 small 10mm-rectangles inside. 

![](../images/week04/kerf01.jpg) 

- The file was saved in pdf format before sending to the laser cutter.
- The material we used to cut is MDF 3mm and Acryclic 3mm.
- Then we measured the size of the big one and the small onces after cutting to see the difference. To make it easy to calculate, we also used 2-side taps to help position the material on paper, and made use of the digital calculator.
![](../images/week04/kerf02.jpg) 
- After cutting: Interestingly, both the MDF and the Acrylic demonstrated clearly the kerf. 
	- With MDF material: 
		□ The designed size for the big rectangle we wanted to cut is 100 mm, but the real size is 100.03 mm.
		
		![](../images/week04/kerf03.jpg)
		
		□  Similarly, 10 small rectangles were set to be 10 mm each (which accounted for 100 mm whole), but the value after cutting for 10 small rectangles together is 98.70 mm.		
		
		![](../images/week04/kerf04.jpg) 
		
		□  Here we can see the gap, and the Kerf we calculated is 0.13 mm.
