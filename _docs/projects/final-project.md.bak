# Final Project - Initial idea

Getting inspired when riding a bike around Oulu these days, I come up with an idea to make a tool which will be mounted on the front of the bike (bike handlebar) to keep various things such as flashlight, phone, camera...

Although definitely, I know that I can use some kind of rubber band to help keeping those things, but obviously it does not look good. 
As such, I think of making "a thing" (temporary namedly "Kokippu") secured on the bike handlebar with its main function is to hold necessary things for biker, for example: flashlight, phone, camera, Gopro.
In addition, the product could be developed further to have a charging function for electronic devices it is holding. My idea is that a small solar power bank can be integrated into the Kokippu, and its power will be utilized to charge phone/cam/flashlight on the ride.
However, this idea may face challenges in certain areas where sunlight is limited like Finland. So I also think of using dynamo power bank instead. 
Moreover, we may install a sensor to Kokippu so that it can detect

Actually, besides the product could fulfill my personal need, I guess it also meets others' demand. 

- It can be seen clearly that every biker would need it because it is convenient, helpful and compact ( 4 in 1 : holding flashlight, phone, camera, Gopro). 
- Students with limited budget would love to use it to hang their existing normal flashlight (at home), without having to spend too much on buying too many accessories such as special flashlight for bike.
- Food-delivering staff with the need to use phone almost everytime such as for searching map, or checking ordersâ€¦, would use it more often because it helps them hand-free to follow the map while keep riding.
- Vloggers who love to capture and record as much as possible all of the moments would find it useful, since they can hang their phone/cam on the bike and turn it on while still riding, speaking and enjoying the scene
