# 5. Invention, intellectual property and income

This week I have learnt about difference among licenses (patent, copyright, trademark) and the development of any possible business idea for the product I want to make.

Assignment:

- Develop a plan for dissemination of your final project.

- Prepare drafts of your summary slide (presentation.png, 1920x1080) and video clip (presentation.mp4, 1080p HTML5, < ~minute, < ~10 MB) and put them in your root directory

## Motivation behind the product

My starting point for my product is just aimed to fulfill my personal need. 
I am actually quite curious of the saying that Oulu is famous as a winter cycling city. 
Therefore, despite the advices from my family and friends back home that it is very dangerous when biking in winter, with curiosity and advanterous characteristics, I bought myself a second-hand bike and took the first tour around. 
Then I realized people here when riding, they have equipped themselves many accessories such as reflector, vest, flashlight in the front and back… so as to be seen in the dark. 
In which I think the most important is the flashlight. 
When I moved to Oulu, I have brought myself a good flashlight from my hometown, so I want to make use of it. 
However, there is nothing to attach and secure it to the front of my bike. 
I know that I can use some kind of rubber band, but obviously it does not look good. 
As such, I think of making "a thing" secured on the bike and help holding my flashlight. 
Moreover, I love photographing and recording every beautiful road and moments I have been through. 
Therefore I also think of integrating into "my product other functions/mechanism/design to hold phone or camera or even Gopro. 

## Dissemination plan

Actually, besides my product could fulfill my personal need, when thinking of the prospective future of it, I believe it also has a potential to go on a business because of its functionalities. 
Firstly, it can be seen clearly that every biker would need it because it is convenient, helpful and compact ( 4 in 1 : holding flashlight, phone, camera, Gopro). 
Secondly, target group is also large, which can range from students with limited budget, food-delivering staff with the need to use phone almost everytime (for searching map, or checking orders…), to vbloggers … 
Finally, with the market share on wide range of users, companies doing business related to bicycle can consider it as an add-on or accessories.

To disseminate the product, I think:

- Phase 1: I would post / share and survey it within the biker community to get it tested. 

- Phase 2: after the product has been finished and adjusted accordingly, it can be introduced to some bike shops or supermartkets like sampling or pre-launching. 

- Phase 3: if the feedback is good, I can collaborate with some designers to make it more attractive and fashionable, and maybe some manufacturers for mass production.

## Licenses

I think my idea is not novel because it is more likely the combination of what we already have (rubber band, selfie stick, tripod). 
Therefore, I would love to share the idea to other people and would be glad if others could remix and re-design it effeciently.
Apart from that, I would like to have some kind of acknowledgement or credit (such as mentioning my name) if my idea is being used.


### Creatives Common (CC)

>Creative Commons is a tool to help us share our work. 
>It is also a free and easy-to-use copyright licenses platform, which provide a simple, standardized way to grant the public permission to use our creative work under copyright law.

There are 6 different license types which can be found with more details => <https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/>

For my product, I would choose:

- Attribution (BY): meaning if my idea is being used by others, they must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. 

- ShareAlike (SA): meaning if others take my idea/product, remix, transform, or build upon the material, they must distribute their contributions under the same license as the original.

- (CC): this appears in almost every license and mean “Approved for Free Cultural Works.” When you apply these licenses to material you create, it meets the Freedom Defined definition of a “Free Cultural Work.” Free cultural works are the ones that can be most readily used, shared, and remixed by others, and go furthest toward creating a commons of freely reusable materials.

### MIT

For licening the software used in the project, I would consider to choose MIT license from <https://opensource.org/>
The license would include no limitation to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so.

## Income

I have no intention to make any income with the project. 
Nevertheless, as mentioned above, I think it is possible to get income if the product is well-developed and further designed.
Once its functionality and design have been finished, selling it separately or as an extra tool with bicycle would bring profit.

## Slide & Video

I have not yet realized the exact product I would like to make, so for this Slide and Video, I will make it as a placeholder.
